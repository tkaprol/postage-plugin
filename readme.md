# WordPress Plugin for Postageapp Integration

This WordPress plugin allows to send e-mails from Postageapp.com. 

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you’re currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to be changed.
* The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
* The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.

## Installation

The plugin can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". 

## i18n Support

Plugin already has i18n support. Please send pull requests for translation files for the languages. You may use following tools to translate:
